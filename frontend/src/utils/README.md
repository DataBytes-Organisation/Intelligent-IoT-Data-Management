# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility functions and helper modules that can be used throughout the application.

## Examples

- `helpers.js`: General helper functions.
- Additional utility files as needed.

Utility functions help to keep the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by providing reusable logic.
