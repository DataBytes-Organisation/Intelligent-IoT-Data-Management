## Window Slider Module
- Branch: feature/window-slider-arnav
- Module Path: window_slider/

This module introduces a window slider mechanism tailored for efficient processing of IoT sensor data streams. By implementing sliding window techniques, it enables real-time analytics, anomaly detection, and data smoothing, which are crucial for intelligent IoT data management systems.

### Features
- Sliding Window Processing: Implements fixed-size sliding windows to segment continuous data streams for batch processing.
- Real-time Analytics: Facilitates immediate computation of statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation) within each window.
- Anomaly Detection Integration: Supports integration with anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest within each windowed segment.
- Data Smoothing: Applies smoothing techniques to reduce noise and enhance signal quality.
- Modular Design: Designed for easy integration with other components of the Intelligent IoT Data Management system.
