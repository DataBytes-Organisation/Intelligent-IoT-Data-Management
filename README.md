## Final Files

- **get_correlation.py**  
  Contains the core function to calculate correlations between columns in a dataset. It is designed to help identify relationships between sensor readings in IoT applications.

- **IoT_Data_Management_correlation_Maxmelon-final.ipynb**  
  A test and demo notebook that calls the function from `get_correlation.py` using sample sensor data. It demonstrates how to apply the function and visualize the correlation results.

## Usage

1. Import the function from `get_correlation.py`.
2. Load your dataset (e.g., from a CSV file).
3. Call the function to compute correlations.

This tool is useful for feature selection, anomaly detection, or general exploratory data analysis in IoT systems.
