# Correlation and Anomaly Detection Study – IoT Sensor Data

This notebook (`correlation_devanshi.ipynb`) presents a focused study on sensor correlation and anomaly detection within complex IoT datasets, contributing to the broader goal of intelligent data management and backend integration.

## Overview

- Conducted correlation analysis between multiple IoT sensors to understand interdependencies using visual tools such as a correlation heatmap and rolling correlation plots.
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify variance and underlying patterns in the dataset.
- Implemented Z-score–based anomaly detection to highlight deviations in sensor readings.
- All visual outputs—including rolling correlations, PCA explained variance plots, and anomaly detection visualizations—are saved as `.png` files to assist with integration into the frontend interface.

## Purpose

The study supports the identification of relevant sensor features for future machine learning models while ensuring that the outputs are interpretable and integration-ready. The exported visualizations and processed datasets align with the needs of the web team and backend engineers.
